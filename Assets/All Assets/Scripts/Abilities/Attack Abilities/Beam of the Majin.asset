  Title: Beam of the Majin
  Description: Aim and Fire a straight beam towards the enemy. Has 6 Levels. Scales
    by DMG and Size.
  Lore: The Majin, a race of intelligent monsters, are one of the many races found
    in Drakoria. As one of the strongest, these demonic people specialize in magic.
    While most Majin are indifferent or friendly to the other races inhabiting the
    world, they still face scrutiny and fear from some humans, viewing them as dangerous
    and evil. A magic-born, their specialization in magic led them to develop a signature
    spell - one of concentrated magic that, when unleashed, creates a devastating
    beam of power and destruction unique to them. The Majin, however, can teach this
    spell to others. The difficulty of learning it, however, is incredibly high.
