  Title: Thorns of the Great Forest
  Description: Wrap yourself in deadly thorns. Any enemies that hit you also gets
    damage dealt to them.
  Lore: Tied to the untamed wilds of Drakoria, the Great Forest stretches across
    the vast lands. Drawing power from the sentient, thorn-covered trees that protect
    the heart of the forest, those skilled enough can wrap themselves around these
    thorns, protecting them from anyone with the aim of harming them.
