  Title: Dryad's Aura
  Description: Summon a protective circle around you, dealing damage over time to
    enemies within the circle.
  Lore: Representations of Mother Nature itself, the Dryads are a mystical and revered
    race in Drakoria. These tree fairies, worshiped by many, act as wardens for the
    many lush forests and pockets of nature that are scattered throughout Drakoria.
    As protectors of all things nature, they naturally watch over those who are well
    liked by the fauna and environment, sometimes showing special treatment to those
    exemplary and equally appreciative and protective of their home. As such, some
    Dryads tend to partner up with others, acting as a guiding or protective spirit
    at times, whenever in their domain or at times when called upon.
