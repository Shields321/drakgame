  Title: The Akashic Records
  Description: Summon books to rotate around you to deal damage to any enemies that
    come into contact with it. Can be upgraded six times to increase damage and book
    amount.
  Lore: Housing all the events from the past, present, and near future, the Akashic
    Records of Drakoria are not as rare as one would assume. Standard issue in learning
    institutions, they're quite accessible and pillars of the highest levels of education
    found in this world. While the near future is written in the Akashic Records,
    new updated copies must be produced or found to continue peering into the future
    as it can only look two to three years forward. The High Sages, however, can
    channel another use out of the records, combining knowledge and magic together
    to create a book that acts as a familiar, protecting and fighting alongside their
    user.
