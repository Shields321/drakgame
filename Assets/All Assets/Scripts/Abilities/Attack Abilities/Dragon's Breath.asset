  Title: Dragon's Breath
  Description: Unleash a powerful beam in random directions, dealing damage to enemies
    it hits
  Lore: Originating from the legendary Dragons themselves, Dragon's Breath is a powerful
    magic spell that mimics their signature move. Ancient and mighty, the dragons
    once ruled the skies of Drakoria, but now they are few and far between. Their
    breath, able to scorch entire landscapes and turn cities into ash, was highly
    sought after by the other races in Drakoria, particularly the humans. Its immense
    power is balanced by its danger to its user. If the wielder lacks control, the
    flames can consume them whole. Mastery requires deep knowledge and constant practice
    or to have draconic blood within you.
