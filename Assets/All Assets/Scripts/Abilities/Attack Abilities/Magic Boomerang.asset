  Title: Magic Boomerang
  Description: hoot out a projectile. The projectile travels outwards for a certain
    distance before returning to you to deal damage to any enemies hit. Can be upgraded
    six times to increase damage.
  Lore: When learning magic, instructors always mentioned that in order to feel magic,
    activate magic, and conjure it in reality, you had to picture what you wanted
    vividly. If you wanted to cast a type of explosion magic, you had to envision
    what goes into the explosion, how the explosion activates, the aftermath, and
    everything in between. The toll on the mind is almost as great as the cost of
    mana, with more complex and powerful spells requiring more mana. One of the first
    spells you tried was an arc of magic power to shoot out like a boomerang, returning
    to you and dealing twice the damage, dispersing before hitting you. It had some
    holes, but to your surprise, it worked. You've been using it ever since as a
    reminder of where you started.
