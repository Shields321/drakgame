  Title: Tentacles of the Abyss
  Description: Channel tentacles out from the abyss, dealing damage to any enemies
    within its grasp.
  Lore: Dark magic is powerful, rare, and forbidden for most. The sheer power and
    corruptive nature of this element has led to many conflicts in the past, creating
    villainous characters time after time. The masters of dark magic, however, are
    able to resist the calls of the void and utilize their power without restriction.
    Despite its rarity and forbidden nature, like other elements, it is fairly easy
    to require. Through teaching, grimoires, or first-hand experience, one can acquire
    the powers of the abyss. The catch? Teaching of dark magic is strictly forbidden,
    while almost all known grimoires are kept under lock and key.
