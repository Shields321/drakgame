  Title: The Frontline Mage
  Description: Re-enact the actions of one of the most famous mages in Drakoria,
    doubling your HP and Movement Speed
  Lore: A legendary technique passed down by one of the greatest mages in Drakoria's
    history. Some called him brave, others called him insane. Despite the mage's
    immense power and offensive magic abilities, they were always known as a mid-range
    or supportive class. Getting up close and personal was always a job for the swordsmen
    and other weapon wielders. Magister Arion, however, broke this stereotype, casting
    magic upon himself and abandoning his position to fight on the front lines. His
    actions were not only successful, but filled other mages with similar ideals
    to follow in his footsteps.
