  Title: The Demon's Enchantment
  Description: Call upon the demon race and activate the enchanment to increase your
    strength to deal increased damage to any enemies far away. Can be upgraded three
    times to increase damage.
  Lore: A forbidden pact sealed between the user and the terrifying high demons under
    the blood moon. The Daemon's are a second evolution of regular demonfolk, brought
    upon by their immense strength and power, causing them to rise up the ranks to
    become one of the leaders of demonkind. The Enchantment offers a surge of power
    like no other - a violet surge of demonic might, manifesting when they are distanced
    from their prey to eliminate their weaknesses and to stay as dangerous as possible
    from any range. It is not a gift freely given, however. A mark connects the wielder's
    soul to the infernal realms, forever binding them to the demon race. Rarely taught
    to non-demons, even more so for humans, means that those with this enchantment
    are recognized as important friends and allies to the demon race.
