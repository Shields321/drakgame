  Title: Kiss of Life
  Description: When hitting an enemy, heal a small amount of HP. Can be upgraded
    three times to increase amount of health gained.
  Lore: Drawn from the forbidden arts of Dark Magic, those delving deep into the
    element can unlock the power to manipulate life and death itself. By striking
    down their enemies, the wielder siphons a portion of their life essence, absorbing
    it and using it for themselves - a brief and potent surge of healing. The power
    to draw life from others, however, is considered a dangerous temptation, even
    for those specializing in the element. Those who feed off the suffering and death
    of others too freely risk being consumed by the very forces they manipulate.
