  Title: Swordsmith's Parry
  Description: There is a small chance that an enemy attack does zero damage. Can
    be upgraded six times to increase the chance of negating an attack.
  Lore: A legendary technique passed down through generations of master swordsmiths
    and duelists. Said to have been mastered by the first legendary Swordsmith, Valdran.
    Sought after by all who wield a sword, the parry was a move once thought to be
    impossible at worst, or inconsistent and worthless at best. However, the technique
    has grown and evolved over the years, becoming a tool all swordfighters must
    learn and utilize effectively. A blade is not just metal. It is a living entity
    with a flow and energy that can be harnessed. Those who wield the sword align
    themselves with this flow to deflect incoming strikes with a mere flick of their
    wrist.
