  Title: The Will of a Creator
  Description: Become invincible for a short amount of time once reaching a certain
    amount of HP. Can be upgraded three times to increase duration.
  Lore: Drakoria is home to many gods, goddesses, and other divine entities. Apart
    from a select few, these beings tend to be hands-off when it comes to the affairs
    of this world. You, however, think you may be one of these select few. Upon your
    arrival to this world, you started hearing a voice in your head; a whisper. Whenever
    deep in thought and filled with distraught and questions, this voice tends to
    soothe you and clear your mind. Whenever faced with death, it is as if you're
    brought back to life for the tiniest of moments, given a second chance to quickly
    escape, heal, or secure the kill.
  Upgarde: 1
  Chance: 25
