  Title: Elven Holy Garments
  Description: Don the garments forged by the secret Elven race to slightly decreasing
    all damage taken. Cannot be upgraded.
  Lore: Forged in the sanctum of the Elven High Priests, these holy garments are
    revered as a sacred relic, imbued with divine protection from the spirits. Its
    power is only matched by its rarity. The Elven race is extremely secluded and
    secretive, rarely appearing outside of their forest. Items crafted by the elves
    are typically reserved for themselves, and as such, one would be hard-pressed
    to get their hands on it without requesting it from the Elven High Priest themselves,
    but their secrecy and secluded nature also means that they are equally weary
    and suspicious of any and all outsiders, their trust nearly impossible to gain.
