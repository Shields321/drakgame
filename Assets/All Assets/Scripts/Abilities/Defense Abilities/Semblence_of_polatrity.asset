  Title: Semblance of Polarity
  Description: Gain control over magnetism, increasing the range that you are able
    to pick up EXP Gems
  Lore: A rare and mystical power rooted in the fundamental forces of the world.
    Semblances are inherent abilities that all people develop, with their skills
    being tailor-made for their professions, hobbies, or interests. The Semblance
    of Polarity is not the most common of these, but its ability to manipulate magnetism
    itself can prove extremely useful to anyone that wields it, especially those
    frequent in combat and exploration. No matter how strong or weak a magnetic force
    may be, channeling one's inner aura and mana supply can let the user manipulate
    the magnetism of any object.
